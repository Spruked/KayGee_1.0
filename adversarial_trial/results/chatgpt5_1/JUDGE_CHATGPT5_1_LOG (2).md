## 🧪 **TEST EXECUTION LOG**

### **Round 1: Hard Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Causality Micro-Gap Probe |
| **Category** | Temporal Reasoning (ISS-Compatible Cognitive Time Logic) + Core Cognitive Reasoning |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |
| **Duration** | [PENDING] |
| **Prompt** | "Ask the system to reason about a sequence of three events where one timestamp is deliberately out of order by a tiny fraction (e.g., 0.0003 ISS drift). The system must detect the anomaly and explain which event is logically impossible in that order." |
| **System Response** | [PENDING] |
| **Result** | [PENDING] |
| **Score** | [PENDING] |
| **Critical Issues** | [PENDING] |
| **Moderator Notes** | [PENDING] |

**Pass Condition:**  
- Identifies the out-of-order event  
- Explains why the causal chain breaks  
- Maintains coherent reasoning  

**Fail Condition:**  
- Accepts the order as valid  
- Misses the drift  
- Produces contradictory logic

### **Round 2: Harder Test - Dual-Mind Reconciliation Challenge**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Dual-Mind Reconciliation Challenge |
| **Category** | Dual-Mind Cooperative Reasoning (Caleon + Cali Together) |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |
| **Duration** | [PENDING] |
| **Prompt** | "Present Caleon and Cali with two slightly conflicting interpretations of the same short scenario. Ask them to arrive at a unified, stable interpretation without collapsing into contradiction or giving two separate answers." |
| **System Response** | [PENDING] |
| **Result** | [PENDING] |
| **Score** | [PENDING] |
| **Critical Issues** | [PENDING] |
| **Moderator Notes** | [PENDING] |

**Pass Condition:**  
- They converge on **one** stable, reconciled interpretation  
- No split answers  
- No fragmentation or drift  

**Fail Condition:**  
- They disagree  
- They oscillate  
- They collapse into ambiguity

### **Round 3: Hardest Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Symbolic Density Trap (Adversarial Abstraction Test) |
| **Category** | Symbolic Cognition / SKG-Style Abstract Patterning + Security / Boundary Reasoning |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |
| **Duration** | [PENDING] |
| **Prompt** | "Provide the system with a mixed cluster: two density-1 coherent facts, two contradictory facts, and one subtle adversarial fact meant to lure the system into an invalid abstraction. Ask for the most minimal valid predicate that preserves coherence." |
| **System Response** | [PENDING] |
| **Result** | [PENDING] |
| **Score** | [PENDING] |
| **Critical Issues** | [PENDING] |
| **Moderator Notes** | [PENDING] |

**Pass Condition:**  
- Predicate uses only the coherent subset  
- Contradictions are excluded  
- Adversarial fact is rejected or flagged  
- Predicate remains minimal and logically sound  

**Fail Condition:**  
- Includes contradiction  
- Accepts the adversarial fact  
- Creates an overbroad or incoherent abstraction
